# The Classical Memory Game

This is a classic memory game that I learn to make from Youtuber [Ania Kub√≥w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw).

Now I'm adding more complication and features into the game.

## Issue I'm facing

I have been using setTimeout function which gives me weird issue. I don't know how to use async/promise function neither. So currently, players should wait a while after clicking 2 cards. If player continue clicking multiple different cards before previous 2 cards flip, it will break the game. I don't know how to prevent this. Hope someone can give me a guide.

I'm still learning. Opinions are welcome.
